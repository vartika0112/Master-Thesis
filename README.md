# Deep Neural Networks for Cell Identification from scRNA sequence data (Master-Thesis: Data Science and Society)

The datasets used in this thesis can be obtained from https://zenodo.org/record/4557712.

The function folder contains the methods for the generalized model of ANN and 1D-CNN along with other methods built to support in running the experiments.

The experiments folder contains the notebooks having the experiments run on the different datasets to evaluate the models built.
